# Building Grids with CSS

### Objective:
- Build a grid mimicking the ones in the images folder using selectors and declarations.
- Practice using Semantic HTML
- Things to think about: box models, floats, displays, width calculations.
- Make them responsive

####Example.png
 - Your HTML should consist of all 'div' tags with the same class names as what's shown in the image
 - Practice using your selectors!
 - Example:
    ```
    <div class='row'>
      .row
      <div class ='col-4'>
        .col-4
      </div>
      <div class ='col-8'>
        .col-8
      </div>
    </div>
  ```
